This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: inconsistent error handling. The `bug.js` file shows an example of an app that doesn't properly handle errors that might occur during asynchronous operations. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses this issue by implementing centralized error handling and returning appropriate error responses to the client.
